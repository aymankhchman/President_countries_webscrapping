# President_countries_webscrapping

In this project I was interested in finding which countries had president who stayed a very long time . 
Since I didn't find an available data I scrapped the data from wikipedia , the dataset is not perfect but it does the job well . 
More intersting question can be asked , as I found another dataset which explain "Happiness" in each country (well being , heelth care , opportunity .. )

We can check the correlation of happiness,liberty of expression and so on with the number of year a president has been in power.

As we can see in this notebook , the last graph demonstrate that Africa has a long way to reach democrac .
